            <p class="description">The purpose of a Design System varies a lot between different companies. Copying the popular approaches of others is easy and appealing, but without their resources, was a recipe for failure and fatigue. To find our purpose, we had to evolve over a number of years through trial and error. Optimising first for usability, then contribution, and  finally — the fastest way to develop new ideas.</p>

<p>Goal — why was this valuable? we can’t do everything, but there are many different users of the brand internally, help centre, website, satelite sites, mini owners of the brand, project archipelago, but also different perspectives of what makes it good. needed to bring them in to help co-design ideas
Role — what did I do? ran workshops, loom playbacks, and iterating in public
Impact — what was the outcome? a shared understanding of what we wanted to focus on</p>

  <li>Optimise for flow</li>

            <p class="description">While Design Systems need to be abstracted well to be successful, we were finding gaps and unintended consequences of the system when features launched. I wanted to find ways to proactively bring in more internal perspectives, real data, and unplanned use cases to road test our system against the real world. This helped create a more resilient system, and to ship things we’re more confident won’t warp under the pressure of reality.</p>
