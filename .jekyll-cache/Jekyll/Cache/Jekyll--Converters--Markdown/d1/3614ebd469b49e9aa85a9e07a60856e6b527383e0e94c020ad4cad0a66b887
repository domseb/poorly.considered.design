<p>In early 2017, Qwilrâ€™s NPS was withering from a conceptually novel editor, that was struggling to deliver on itâ€™s promise. Working with content was confusing, unpredictable and buggy. â€” not just from other tools, but from within the editor itself.</p>

<p>Over 5 years, I lead the editorâ€™s transformation from a nascent offering, to a sophisticated market differentiator. A journey I started as an IC, and ended as a leader. This graduation of roles allowed me to explore a deeply challenging space from multiple vantage points, and Iâ€™m incredibly proud of the impact and attention to detail achieved during this time.</p>

            <p class="description">Qwilr was a fully WYSIWYG editor, and while it had visually simple UI, it was frustratingly unclear and unreliable in use. A legacy codebase made fixes unbearably slow, especially without a clear picture of how everything should work together. We started over, committing to a full rewrite and redesign of the editor from the ground up.</p>

<h3 id="inconsistent-to-intuitive">Inconsistent, to intuitive</h3>

<p>At this stage, there was less than a dozen full time employees at Qwilr, and customers tended to be solo founders, companies of one, or tiny agencies. Resource strapped, but eyeing up a move to mid-market, the editor simply wasnâ€™t at a standard to compete at a higher price point.</p>

<h4 id="approach">Approach</h4>

<h3 id="back-to-first-principles">Back to first principles</h3>

<p>The previous editor suffered from a lack of clarity on how it should all work together. When to follow the conventions, when not to, and why. Reflecting on this, I started by writing down principles for the type of editor we wanted to create.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enable focus</li>
  <li>Optimise for flow</li>
  <li>Match intentions</li>
  <li>Reward play</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="harmonising-behaviours">Harmonising behaviours</h3>

<p>Guiding principles in place, I set off researching the minutiae of how the best editors worked. How they handled formatted text from the clipboard, keyboard shortcuts, re-ordering content, and more. Making note of what felt smooth in use, what felt rough, and comparing this to how the existing editor behaved.</p>

<p>I found that the best editors were the result of countless small and thoughtful details. Details that worked in harmony, but often felt invisible in use. To create a shared language in the team, I wrote new definitions for every behaviour and action you could take in the new editor. What the desired outcome should be, and why. Part north star and part spec, this became a touchstone during the project, and a foundation to build off for years to come.</p>
