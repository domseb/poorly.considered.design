I"¦<p>Personalising a page to a prospect takes time, and compounds as sales teams get larger. Templates in Qwilr were a faster way to personalise pages, pulling in real data from their CRM. The feature initially was impossible to discover though, and when customers did it was brittle and extremely limited. This transformation project fixed that original automation workflow, extended it, and fleshed out a longer term vision for where we needed to go.</p>

        <p>In early 2017, Qwilrâ€™s editor was in its infancy. It promised a quick way for anyone to create highly visual &amp; interactive proposals, but controls were also limited and highly guard-railed, clashing with the long standing mental models created by Word et al. Core editing behaviours were also inconsistent, buggy, and often unclear to new customers, and our lack of intention designing them was reflected in the code that built them. Struggling to update capabilities or introduce new ones, we decided to redesign and rebuild the editorâ€™s foundations. To rethink how every editing experience should work holistically, and build on for years to come.</p>

        The previous share experience was an overlay, with limited controls, where youâ€™d lose context of what you were sharing. Changing share settings was also inconsistent, with unclear impacts on the experience of viewing it. I consolidated and refined the experience, adding new capabilities into a simpler, more intuitive experience.
