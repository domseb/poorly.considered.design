I"¬<p>Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot? Yes! Yesterdayâ€™s jam. That is what we are to them!â€¦ Actually, that doesnâ€™t work, as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages. Huh, what you think Iâ€™m afraid of you? Iâ€™m not afraid of you. OK. Moss, what did you have for breakfast this morning? Smarties cereal. How can you twoâ€¦ Donâ€™t Google the question, Moss! Yes! Yesterdayâ€™s jam. That is what we are to them!â€¦ Actually, that doesnâ€™t work, as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s like theyâ€™re pally-wally with us when thereâ€™s a problem with their printer, but once itâ€™s fixedâ€¦ No, no there you go, no there you go. I just heard it come on. Huh, what you think Iâ€™m afraid of you? Iâ€™m not afraid of you. Huh, what you think Iâ€™m afraid of you? Iâ€™m not afraid of you. Iâ€™m going to murder youâ€¦ You bloody woman! Today I have a business empire the like of which the world has never seen the like of which. I hope it doesnâ€™t sound arrogant when I say that I am the greatest man in the world!</p>
