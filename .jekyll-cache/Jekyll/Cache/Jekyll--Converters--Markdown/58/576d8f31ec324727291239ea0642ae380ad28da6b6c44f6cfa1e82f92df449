I"¥<p>I was talking to a close friend recently, someone who I think is a very good writer, who helps edit my excessive use of commas in sentences (he didnâ€™t have time for this post), when he said heâ€™s started to think of writing like exercise. A process that feels arduous and unpleasant, but once itâ€™s all done, you just feel better for having done it. Another run under your belt. Another post out in the world.</p>
