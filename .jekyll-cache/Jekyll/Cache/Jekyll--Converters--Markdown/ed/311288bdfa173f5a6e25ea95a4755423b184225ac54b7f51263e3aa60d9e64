I"ô<p>Iâ€™ve had a great year. In 2016 I was lucky enough to go to New Zealand, Hawaii, New York, London, Norway and Tokyo â€“ whilst having a full time job. I submitted my permanent residency visa application in Australia, got promoted, and got engaged. Amongst all these great things, thereâ€™s also been a few hard lessons thatâ€™ve been great catalysts for personal growth. In line with this, Iâ€™ve added a â€œlessons learnedâ€ section to the format I gave last yearâ€™s brief year in review.</p>
