<p>My role changed a lot during my 5 years at Qwilr. First to establish and grow design at Qwilr, then to manage the product teams, and finally into leadership as VP Design. From fine detail to broader brush strokes, working at each vantage point gave me a better perspective of the whole. Below are my highlights of that journey. What I learned and loved from a very meaningful chapter of my career.</p>

            <p class="description">I was the first design hire at Qwilr, given the role to establish and scale the value of good design across the company. The understanding of how design worked was limited, giving me the opportunity to start from a blank slate. To  shape our early ways of working, and move Design from being reactive firefighter, to a proactive partner in Product.</p>

<h3 id="visualising-how-work-happened-in-the-product">Visualising how work happened in the product</h3>

<p>When I joined, Dylan (Qwilr‚Äôs CEO &amp; cofounder) was communicating design ideas through a series of sketches and scrapbooks of screenshots. With only a ‚Äúplatform team‚Äù of 4 engineers, work was spread across Asana, gDocs, and in heads. Intractable to anyone outside the team. Before I could set new expectations about Design‚Äôs place in all this, we first needed to make this broader workflow clear, and visible to the company.</p>

<p>To reduce this sprawl, I moved the company to Notion, and designed new workflows, optimised for one of Qwilr‚Äôs core principles ‚Äî ‚Äúclarity through collaboration‚Äù. Creating a traceable line between roadmap, individual teams, projects and their tasks. Created shared definitions for priorities, how work progressed and why. This system scaled with us through the years to come, increased how effectively we could collaborate, and allowed me to visualise how Design worked.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-place-for-designers-to-thrive">Creating a place for designers to thrive</h3>

<p>As I grew the design team, I needed to scaffold the structure for designers to thrive and grow at Qwilr. Both the basic (tooling, templates and systems), and the meaningful (career growth, develop the voice of Design at the company, and more inclusive creative practices). Each new hire came in with fresh eyes, and shined a light on what we could do to improve. Refining my skills as a leader, and my ability to empower the team to thrive.</p>

            <p class="description">In a scaling startup, there‚Äôs always daylight between a team‚Äôs ambitions for quality and what it can deliver. Now guiding all the product teams, my role became concerned with minimising that gap, by having excellence as a shared concern across teams. To get teams closer to customers, and feel first hand how to deliver them better experiences.</p>

<h3 id="starting-together">Starting together</h3>

<p>Throughout my career, the most impactful and enjoyable projects have had close knit teams that started on the problem together. Run more like a search party for the best idea, with a diffusion of responsibilities, than a 3 legged race, everyone in lurching forward in lockstep. I established this practice at Qwilr, leading off-sites, retreat workshops, and remote first project kickoff practices to empower teams to forge stronger collaborative bonds, and deliver their best work.</p>

<h3 id="establishing-demos-and-dogfooding-rituals">Establishing demos and dogfooding rituals</h3>

<p>Demos and dogfooding rituals allow teams to get other perspectives on their work, visibility on what others are creating, and to celebrate progress together. To find ways to actually use the tool as our customers do, feel it‚Äôs shortcomings first hand, and spur ideas from everyone on ways to improve it. I‚Äôve loved refined these practices over the years ‚Äî from kickoffs, weekly showcases to final experience reviews ‚Äî to make it easy and valuable to bring in perspectives from across the company. Helping minimising blindspots and biases in the work, and creating much better experiences for customers.</p>

<h3 id="celebrating-launches">Celebrating launches</h3>

<p>Through a customer feedback call, we saw accounts in different languages visually broke a handful of key components in a way we had never seen. We needed a way to quickly see how things behaved in different languages, at different character lengths, without manually adding them into designs. I roughed out a concept, and Hamish built it out as a plugin, to give as a simple and fast way to ‚Äúroulette‚Äù data into our designs.</p>

To me the best explorations are like mountaineering ‚Äî where Designers, Engineers and PMs have the freedom to explore independently, but come together early and often. My role was to paint a picture of the peak we were trying to reach, to create the space and direction to solve it well, and contribute concepts.</p>

<h3 id="prototyping-vision">Prototyping vision</h3>

<p>Qwilr is full of complex interactive challenges. To have real confidence in the experiences we designed, we needed to feel them in use, beyond static Figma mockups. To alleviate this bottleneck, and leverage the hard work the team had invested into Kaleidoscope, I defined a new north star to refocus our efforts. Optimising for teams to prototype and play with new ideas quickly, across Design and Engineering.</p>
