I"µ<p>Well everyone, Iâ€™ve finally done it. Iâ€™ve cemented Shortcuts in my life, and Iâ€™m happy to say Iâ€™m well on my way to automated bliss. Iâ€™ve attempted to find this bliss a few times â€” with IFTTT, with the previously named Workflow, with the rarely working smart bulbs â€” but after getting the Apple Watch last year, setting complex things like laundry timers was easier, and the need for Syndrome like power ebbed away.</p>
