<p>I enjoyed a broad remit as VP of Design at Qwilr, helping shape many aspects of the company. From creating strategies, principles, team structures, and rituals to hone craft. The immense challenge is finding a way for them all to work together, and create better impact for it. Below are the highlights that helped give me a deeper understanding of the relationships between strategy, people, intuition and impact.</p>

            <p class="description">Over 5 years Qwilr‚Äôs product teams went from a primitive ‚Äúplatform team‚Äù of engineers, to temporary cross-company project teams, to product area teams, to finally teams organised around JTBD. Each reforging taught me more, sometimes painfully, about how team‚Äôs relate their identity with impact, when quick changes feel responsive vs destructive, and the role of autonomy in effective teams. And how these team structures connect with broader company themes and priorities. Foundational changes that helped us be effective, and collaborate well.</p>

            <p class="description">While Design Systems need to be abstracted well to be successful, we were finding gaps and unintended consequences of the system when features launched. I wanted to find ways to proactively bring in more internal perspectives, real data, and unplanned use cases to road test our system against the real world. This helped create a more resilient system, and to ship things we‚Äôre more confident won‚Äôt warp under the pressure of reality.</p>
