I"ñ3<p>I enjoyed a broad remit as VP of Design at Qwilr, helping shape many aspects of the company. From creating strategies, principles, team structures, and rituals to hone craft. The immense challenge is finding a way for them all to work together, and create better impact for it. Below are the highlights that helped give me a deeper understanding of the relationships between strategy, people, intuition and impact.</p>

        <p>Over 5 years Qwilr‚Äôs product teams went from a primitive ‚Äúplatform team‚Äù of engineers, to temporary cross-company project teams, to product area teams, to finally teams organised around JTBD. Each reforging taught me more, sometimes painfully, about how team‚Äôs relate their identity with impact, when quick changes feel responsive vs destructive, and the role of autonomy in effective teams. And how these team structures connect with broader company themes and priorities. Foundational changes that helped us be effective, and collaborate well.</p>

      <h3>Establishing the role of Design</h3>
      <p>
        When I joined, the process of design was Dylan (Qwilr‚Äôs CEO &amp; co-founder) sketching out ideas, discussing them with Engineers, and getting them built. It was fit for purpose, but the role of Design was entirely reactive. I created a foundational toolkit and process for design, enabling better collaboration, stakeholder awareness, and impact in our work.

      <h3>Organising teams around our JTBD</h3>
      <p>
        Staunchly against ‚ÄúAdam Admin‚Äù personas, I spent time with customers to create our foundational JTBD across the company. Helping understand customer drivers, and summarised them into cards, to be actionable in brainstorming meetings and projects. After some wrestling, I worked with the Head of Engineering and Head of Product to create teams around these JTBD.

      <h3>Ways of working</h3>
      <p>
        While the panel gave them a way to manage the tokens, and navigate them quickly, we wanted to enable a faster way to add them in the flow of writing content. Leveraging the old curly braces as the keyboard shortcut, I designed a new panel lookup for customers. Letting them see what tokens were available to them in context, and adding them without needing to leave their keyboard.

      <h3>Starting together</h3>
      <p>
        Highly interactive experiences need lots of prototyping, and collaboration, to really know if something feels right to use. An ambassador for mountaineering as a model of collaboration, I ran offsites, kickoffs, retreats and projects for PMs, Design &amp; Engineers to start together. Balance blindspots and biases early, and leverage the collective knowledge to create the best solution for the customer.

      <h3>Weekly showcase</h3>
      <p>
        As the number of teams grew, the visibility of their work became more opaque and siloed. After reading Creativity Inc and Creative Selection, I wanted to create a demo culture that changed that, showcasing progress on the actual customer experience. I facilitated weekly showcase that rotated team reps, shared context of what they were working on, and a way to get feedback from fresh eyes that weren‚Äôt in the trenches of the project. It was by far, my favourite meeting of the week.

      <h3>Establishing betas and dogfooding rituals</h3>
      <p>
        Designing and building a tool you never use, makes you blind to its faults. I wanted teams to have greater empathy with the tools they were creating, and find faults and opportunities to improve them well before they were shipped. I created the dogfooding &amp; beta practices for product teams, to bring in perspectives that balanced the teams blindpots and biases, helped us and deliver a more refined experience to customers.

        Design will always be a bottleneck unless experience quality is a shared ownership in the team. To do this well though needs structure, and to proactively bring in perspectives that balance blindspots and biases of the project team. I lead this practice at Qwilr, centering on archetypes and use cases, with artefacts that helped teams make necessary tradeoffs against what the sessions surfaced.

        <p>Frustrated with teams heads down, constantly in the weeds of quarterly planning, I wanted to create space to resolve complex experience debt, and take a meaningful leap forward for customers and the business. To me the best explorations are like mountaineering ‚Äî where Designers, Engineers and PMs have the freedom to explore independently, but come together early and often. My role was to paint a picture of the peak we were trying to reach, to create the space and direction to solve it well, and contribute concepts.</p>

      <h3>Daedalus</h3>
      <p>
        Partnering with Dylan, we first prototyped concepts without constraint, following intuition we‚Äôd developed by marinating in the space. The initial goal was to innovate on Qwilr‚Äôs core capabilities, exploring bigger bets and rethinks that could accelerate the timeline to deliver on the company strategy.  From it sprouted a primitive but interactive collection of product concepts and themes for teams to validate and build off.

      <h3>Experience visions</h3>
      <p>
        Early decisions around the editor‚Äôs mental and interaction models were making it less and less malleable to shape, and harder to push it into new directions. To explore long simmering rethinks, resolve core experience debt, and unlock new opportunities, I created a vision exploration project called Editor 2025. Exploring what we could do with the editor in a timeline outside of quarterly planning, socialised it with teams, and lead ideation with design team.

        As we explored Editor 2025, we were gravitating to a well trodden problem ‚Äî styling qwilr pages. The early transformation concepts would help deepen our differentiator, and unlock capabilities for our growing enterprise accounts. I worked with Hamish to kickoff design sprints, helping accelerate and refine concepts, and engage peers in leadership to adjust our roadmap to prioritise this transformation work.
