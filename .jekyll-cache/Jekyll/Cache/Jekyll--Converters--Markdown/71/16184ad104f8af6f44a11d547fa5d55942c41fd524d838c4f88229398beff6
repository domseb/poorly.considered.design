I"<p>I enjoyed a broad remit as VP of Design at Qwilr, helping shape many aspects of the company. From creating strategies, principles, team structures, and rituals to hone craft. The immense challenge is finding a way for them all to work together, and create better impact for it. Below are the highlights that helped give me a deeper understanding of the relationships between strategy, people, intuition and impact.</p>

        <p>Over 5 years Qwilr’s product teams went from a primitive “platform team” of engineers, to temporary cross-company project teams, to product area teams, to finally teams organised around JTBD. Each reforging taught me more, sometimes painfully, about how team’s relate their identity with impact, when quick changes feel responsive vs destructive, and the role of autonomy in effective teams. And how these team structures connect with broader company themes and priorities. Foundational changes that helped us be effective, and collaborate well.</p>

      <h3>Establishing the role of Design</h3>
      <p>
        When I joined, the process of design was Dylan (Qwilr’s CEO &amp; co-founder) sketching out ideas, discussing them with Engineers, and getting them built. It was fit for purpose, but the role of Design was entirely reactive. I created a foundational toolkit and process for design, enabling better collaboration, stakeholder awareness, and impact in our work.

      <h3>Creating teams around our JTBD</h3>
      <p>
        Staunchly against “Adam Admin” personas, I spent time with customers to create our foundational JTBD across the company. Helping understand customer drivers, and summarised them into cards, to be actionable in brainstorming meetings and projects. After some wrestling, I worked with the Head of Engineering and Head of Product to create teams around these JTBD.

      <h3>Contextual lookup</h3>
      <p>
        While the panel gave them a way to manage the tokens, and navigate them quickly, we wanted to enable a faster way to add them in the flow of writing content. Leveraging the old curly braces as the keyboard shortcut, I designed a new panel lookup for customers. Letting them see what tokens were available to them in context, and adding them without needing to leave their keyboard.

        <p>Customers wanted ways to personalise the content and offer itself to their buyers. Services, rollout details, pricing, all sections they had populated for the buyer in their CRM, but could only add manually into Qwilr. I designed new patterns for how this worked in the product, how it could be automated, forging new patterns to work in the most interactively dense parts of the product.</p>

      <h3>Looping widget</h3>
      <p>
        The simplest form of this automation was content that was formatted exactly the same, repeated for as many entries as there were in the CRM. Unlike simple text tokens, this could take up a large area of the editor, putting strain on the WYSIWYG nature of Qwilr. After lot’s of iteration, and finding ways to make it feel native to the editor but clear it was a different content type — the outcome was the Content Loop. A new component that unlocked a new automation power for templates.

      <h3>Dynamic tables</h3>
      <p>
        Tables were used extensively to communicate inventory, timelines, staffing, phases and more — a lot of information that is already populated in customer’s CRMs, and they wanted a way to remove editing all that information manually. We had to grapple with very tight interaction areas, and retrofitting it into an already overloaded component, but eventually settled on a design that felt intuitive, while communicating how it worked in very small real estate.

      <h3>Dynamic quotes</h3>
      <p>
        Quotes presented our first challenge and opportunity to bring conditions into template automation. While the Content Loop and Table Loop work would add any content associated in the CRM, Quotes were presenting different options to buyer. Customers needed to be able to select what was shown in those options, so they could empower the buyer to select what package best suited them. Also in a very tight interaction areas, and retrofitting it into an already very complex component, I designed a way to leverage simple conditions, in a pattern that could scale as more logic was available in the future.
