            <p class="description">The purpose of a Design System varies a lot between different companies. Copying the popular approaches of others is easy and appealing, but without their resources, was a recipe for failure and fatigue. To find our purpose, we had to evolve over a number of years through trial and error. Optimising first for usability, then contribution, and  finally — the fastest way to develop new ideas.</p>

<p>Goal — why was this valuable? we can’t do everything, but there are many different users of the brand internally, help centre, website, satelite sites, mini owners of the brand, project archipelago, but also different perspectives of what makes it good. needed to bring them in to help co-design ideas
Role — what did I do? ran workshops, loom playbacks, and iterating in public
Impact — what was the outcome? a shared understanding of what we wanted to focus on</p>

<p>Components are referenced in designs, in code, help centres and in launch comms, by different perspectives working in different contexts. We wanted to combine these perspectives to find the most intuitive naming, and create a shared language across teams. I worked closely with Janine, engineers and Diana, to define a taxonomy that could scale as the system grew, and ensure everyone was always on the same page, from design to launch.</p>

<h3 id="emphasizing-interaction">Emphasizing interaction</h3>

<p>We had large blindspots to areas of the product we didn’t use ourselves, and once we had enough of Kaleidoscope live in the product, we needed to feel how these use cases felt to use. I created a ritual called Flow Roulette, that randomised a JTBD archetype and a use case, for the team to run through the (often painful) experience through the lens of that archetype. Creating greater empathy in teams for how it was looking in reality, as well as a good system to pick up low hanging fruit.</p>

<h3 id="shared-surfaces">Shared surfaces</h3>

<p>Through a customer feedback call, we saw accounts in different languages visually broke a handful of key components in a way we had never seen. We needed a way to quickly see how things behaved in different languages, at different character lengths, without manually adding them into designs. I roughed out a concept, and Hamish built it out as a plugin, to give as a simple and fast way to “roulette” data into our designs.</p>
