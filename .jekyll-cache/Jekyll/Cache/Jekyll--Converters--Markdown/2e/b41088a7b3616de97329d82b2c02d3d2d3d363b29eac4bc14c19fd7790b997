I"Ô<p>I enjoyed a broad remit as VP of Design at Qwilr, helping shape many aspects of the company. From creating strategies, principles, team structures, and rituals to hone craft. The immense challenge is finding a way for them all to work together, and create better impact for it. Below are the highlights that helped give me a deeper understanding of the relationships between strategy, people, intuition and impact.</p>

        <p>Over 5 years Qwilr‚Äôs product teams went from a primitive ‚Äúplatform team‚Äù of engineers, to temporary cross-company project teams, to product area teams, to finally teams organised around JTBD. Each reforging taught me more, sometimes painfully, about how team‚Äôs relate their identity with impact, when quick changes feel responsive vs destructive, and the role of autonomy in effective teams. And how these team structures connect with broader company themes and priorities. Foundational changes that helped us be effective, and collaborate well.</p>

      <h3>Establishing the role of Design</h3>
      <p>
        When I joined, the process of design was Dylan (Qwilr‚Äôs CEO &amp; co-founder) sketching out ideas, discussing them with Engineers, and getting them built. It was fit for purpose, but the role of Design was entirely reactive. I created a foundational toolkit and process for design, enabling better collaboration, stakeholder awareness, and impact in our work.

      <h3>Organising teams around our JTBD</h3>
      <p>
        Staunchly against ‚ÄúAdam Admin‚Äù personas, I spent time with customers to create our foundational JTBD across the company. Helping understand customer drivers, and summarised them into cards, to be actionable in brainstorming meetings and projects. After some wrestling, I worked with the Head of Engineering and Head of Product to create teams around these JTBD.

      <h3>Ways of working</h3>
      <p>
        While the panel gave them a way to manage the tokens, and navigate them quickly, we wanted to enable a faster way to add them in the flow of writing content. Leveraging the old curly braces as the keyboard shortcut, I designed a new panel lookup for customers. Letting them see what tokens were available to them in context, and adding them without needing to leave their keyboard.

        <p>Cultures are defined by their default ways of thinking of acting, and when something is ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù can be a loaded subject. Over 5 years I helped create teams that had the mindsets, tools and practices to deliver their best work, and feel proud of what they were shipping to customers. Navigating tensions, negative urgency, and team dynamics, I‚Äôm very proud of the product culture I helped create at Qwilr. </p>

      <h3>Starting together</h3>
      <p>
        Highly interactive experiences need lots of prototyping, and collaboration, to really know if something feels right to use. An ambassador for mountaineering as a model of collaboration, I ran offsites, kickoffs, retreats and projects for PMs, Design &amp; Engineers to start together. Balance blindspots and biases early, and leverage the collective knowledge to create the best solution for the customer.

      <h3>Dynamic tables</h3>
      <p>
        Tables were used extensively to communicate inventory, timelines, staffing, phases and more ‚Äî a lot of information that is already populated in customer‚Äôs CRMs, and they wanted a way to remove editing all that information manually. We had to grapple with very tight interaction areas, and retrofitting it into an already overloaded component, but eventually settled on a design that felt intuitive, while communicating how it worked in very small real estate.

      <h3>Dynamic quotes</h3>
      <p>
        Quotes presented our first challenge and opportunity to bring conditions into template automation. While the Content Loop and Table Loop work would add any content associated in the CRM, Quotes were presenting different options to buyer. Customers needed to be able to select what was shown in those options, so they could empower the buyer to select what package best suited them. Also in a very tight interaction areas, and retrofitting it into an already very complex component, I designed a way to leverage simple conditions, in a pattern that could scale as more logic was available in the future.
