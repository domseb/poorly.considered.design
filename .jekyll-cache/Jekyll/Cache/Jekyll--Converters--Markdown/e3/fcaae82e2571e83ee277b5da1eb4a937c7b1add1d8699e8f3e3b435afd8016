I"—<p>UNSW Sydney (the University of New South Wales), is one of Australiaâ€™s leading research and teaching universities. Their <a href="https://www.2025.unsw.edu.au/">2025 Strategic Plan</a> sets out the priorities and themes that will guide the institution over the next decade, to become â€˜Australiaâ€™s Global Universityâ€™. To help manage this strategy, a dashboard needed to be created to convey the statuses of all programs under 2025, including their current completion status and budget spend.</p>

<h2 id="the-starting-point">The starting point</h2>

<p>The team had already created a working product for the 2025 Dashboard, but it was tricky to navigate, didnâ€™t have a way to follow up with a specific programâ€™s leader, and was hard to understand itâ€™s current status. A primary concern to the stakeholders, was also being able to drill down into key initiatives and programs, and understanding how they roll up into parent programs.</p>

<h2 id="designing-for-clarity">Designing for clarity</h2>

<p>After getting shared understanding on the current product, we worked together to map out key goals, and the ideal flows the stakeholders wanted from the dashboard. Aside from clearer understanding when communicating status and budget allocation, they wanted everything to roll up to a big, exciting 2025 goal, so everyone can see how their projects fit into the larger initiative.</p>

<p>Custom visualisation tools were designed to communicate 2025 in the clearest way possible, including how interactions and areas mapped to mobile viewing. With a constraint of using bootstrap and system fonts, we focussed on using colour for clear status indicators, and creating custom data visualisations components for budget spend and deadline progress.</p>
