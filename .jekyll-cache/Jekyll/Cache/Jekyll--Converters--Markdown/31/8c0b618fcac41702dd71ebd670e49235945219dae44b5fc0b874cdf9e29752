            <p class="description">Qwilr‚Äôs headcount had grown, and with it brought more stakeholders, users and exciting use cases for the brand. To make this rebrand a success (both internally &amp; externally) I wanted to involve departments early in the process, so we could understand what we all needed, and create shared goals to align our efforts around.</p>

<h4 id="challenge">Challenge</h4>

<h3 id="a-sprawling-patchwork">A sprawling patchwork</h3>

<p>The existing brand was suffering from a lack of direction, both visually and strategically. Each area had it‚Äôs own style, without the grounding of a broader narrative. In an effort to get work out quickly, the dreaded amorphous blob had been deployed, as well as stock images, colours without intentionality, and outdated product shots and styles. Worst of all, there was no distinction between our brand and the customer‚Äôs brand. Making it hard for customers to visualise their own success in the product.</p>

<h4 id="approach">Approach</h4>

<h3 id="co-design-workshops">Co-design workshops</h3>

<p>Three key themes emerged early on in discussions. How could the brand be easier to use? How could it have a clearer point of view in the market? How can the brand be more empowering than policing? To co-design the outcome to these questions, I brought in key perspectives through a series of workshops. Helping create a shared understanding of what we all wanted, and really needed, to focus on with our limited resources.</p>

<h3 id="putting-their-brand-first">Putting their brand first</h3>

<p>Components are referenced in designs, in code, help centres and in launch comms, by different perspectives working in different contexts. We wanted to combine these perspectives to find the most intuitive naming, and create a shared language across teams. I worked closely with Janine, engineers and Diana, to define a taxonomy that could scale as the system grew, and ensure everyone was always on the same page, from design to launch.</p>

<h3 id="emphasizing-interaction">Emphasizing interaction</h3>

<p>We had large blindspots to areas of the product we didn‚Äôt use ourselves, and once we had enough of Kaleidoscope live in the product, we needed to feel how these use cases felt to use. I created a ritual called Flow Roulette, that randomised a JTBD archetype and a use case, for the team to run through the (often painful) experience through the lens of that archetype. Creating greater empathy in teams for how it was looking in reality, as well as a good system to pick up low hanging fruit.</p>

<h3 id="shared-surfaces">Shared surfaces</h3>

<p>Through a customer feedback call, we saw accounts in different languages visually broke a handful of key components in a way we had never seen. We needed a way to quickly see how things behaved in different languages, at different character lengths, without manually adding them into designs. I roughed out a concept, and Hamish built it out as a plugin, to give as a simple and fast way to ‚Äúroulette‚Äù data into our designs.</p>

<h3 id="wireframing-to-launch">Wireframing to launch</h3>

<p>Qwilr is full of complex interactive challenges. To have real confidence in the experiences we designed, we needed to feel them in use, beyond static Figma mockups. To alleviate this bottleneck, and leverage the hard work the team had invested into Kaleidoscope, I defined a new north star to refocus our efforts. Optimising for teams to prototype and play with new ideas quickly, across Design and Engineering.</p>
