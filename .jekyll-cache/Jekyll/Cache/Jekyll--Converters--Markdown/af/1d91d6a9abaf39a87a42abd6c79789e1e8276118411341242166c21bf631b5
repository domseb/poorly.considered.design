<p>I started the first version of Qwilrâ€™s Design System, Kaleidoscope, in the first year of joining the company. Leading a small, informal team of ambassadors, we found our north star, and created something much more than just a component library. Becoming a cornerstone of how we designed, collaborated, and experimented with new ideas together.</p>

            <p class="description">The purpose of a Design System varies a lot between different companies. Copying the popular approaches of others is easy and appealing, but without their resources, was a recipe for failure and fatigue. To find our purpose, we had to evolve over a number of years through trial and error. Optimising first for usability, then contribution, and  finally â€” the fastest way to develop new ideas.</p>
