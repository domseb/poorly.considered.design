<p>In early 2017, Qwilrâ€™s NPS was withering from a conceptually novel editor, that was struggling to deliver on itâ€™s promise. Working with content was confusing, unpredictable and buggy. â€” not just from other tools, but from within the editor itself.</p>

<p>Over 5 years, I lead the editorâ€™s transformation from a nascent offering, to a sophisticated market differentiator. A journey I started as an IC, and ended as a leader. This graduation of roles allowed me to explore a deeply challenging space from multiple vantage points, and Iâ€™m incredibly proud of the impact and attention to detail achieved during this time.</p>
