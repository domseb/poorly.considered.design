I"<p>Personalising a page to a prospect takes time, and compounds as sales teams get larger. Templates in Qwilr were a faster way to personalise pages, pulling in real data from their CRM. The feature initially was impossible to discover though, and when customers did it was brittle and extremely limited. This transformation project fixed that original automation workflow, extended it, and fleshed out a longer term vision for where we needed to go.</p>

        <p>To personalise a page with data from their CRM, customers needed to add “tokens” to their templates. Typed with curly brackets (like ), these tokens were impossible to discover and understand as functionality, often unclear what the original CRM references were, and even if they did, prone to typos. I needed to redesign how tokens worked, support creating from more data sources, so customers never had to leave their CRM.</p>

      <h3>Designing a new visual language of “tokens”</h3>
      <p>
        Tokens needed to be easy to scan and interact with on a page, but still be formatted and styled like regular text. Going back to first principles, I wanted tokens to be easily discoverable,  intuitive and tangible. To be a clear building block of automation. I designed a clear visual language and interaction patterns for tokens, that extended to other token types on the horizon.

        The previous share experience was an overlay, with limited controls, where you’d lose context of what you were sharing. Changing share settings was also inconsistent, with unclear impacts on the experience of viewing it. I consolidated and refined the experience, adding new capabilities into a simpler, more intuitive experience.
