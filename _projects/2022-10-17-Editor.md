title: Crafting a best in class editor
path: qwilr-editor

description: I worked on the editor for the full 5 years I was at Qwilr, taking it from nascent offering, to a market differentiator. The transformation, breadth and depth I got to explore in this work has been a career highlight, and something I’m incredibly proud of. Below are some cherry picked highlights of that journey.

        <p>In early 2017, Qwilr’s editor was in its infancy. It promised a quick way for anyone to create highly visual & interactive proposals, but controls were also limited and highly guard-railed, clashing with the long standing mental models created by Word et al. Core editing behaviours were also inconsistent, buggy, and often unclear to new customers, and our lack of intention designing them was reflected in the code that built them. Struggling to update capabilities or introduce new ones, we decided to redesign and rebuild the editor’s foundations. To rethink how every editing experience should work holistically, and build on for years to come.</p>
