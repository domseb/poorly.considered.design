description: It’s just after 5am as I land in Beijing for a 4 hour stopover to London. I open my laptop to connect to the free wifi, and I need to provide a phone number. The only way it can verify me – a tourist at an airport – is to provide a local phone number. Hmmwhat?

That's alright I guess, maybe iMessage will dave the day. Thats a thing right? Nope.

There's only so much eating I can do in the airport in 4 hours. so I’m stuck in limbo—I have nothing to *spend* my time on, I’m going to have to do actually do something with it instead, and it’s an uncomfortable thought.

Frustrated I start queuing to go through to international transfers, which is where the phrase herding cats must have been coined. Anyone who has been to this corner of the world knows how chaotic it is. It’s taken living in a few different countries for me to realise just how british I really am, although you wouldn’t guess by looking at my passport. I always clam up when I pass through the security gates—if I was the on the other side of the process I wouldn’t let me through. My passport looks 50 years old, the seal worn off completely. It’s been in the washing machine, and has bits of sand underneath the plastic from where I ran into Ipanema sea with it in my back pocket. On my way into Australia, the officer quipped “Looks like you made this on the way in love”, and I’m certain if it wasn’t chipped I would never get through these gates on the first try. But I realise on approaching the security gate, that this is a novel situation where it has my full, and completely undivided attention.

Why? Because of the impact of not. If I fuck this up, I will be in the tank for an hour for questioning (this happened on the way out of Crete). So I don’t willingly give this my undivided attention, it’s a necessary cost to bear. It gets my mind spinning the wheel of experiences, to try and find one I willingly have undivided attention on it. Family? I guess, although I’ll always jump on a notification if it comes in. Work? Not at all, it’s a contestant battle weighing up distractions that will affect you now, and which will affect you later. Socially? Not really, we are all normally busy just instagramming the shit out of everything we see. Too busy capturing moments to really understand what it is we feel about them. Reading something printed. I read a weekend paper, and very occasionally read a book (Books vs Cigarettes right now for the curious). I realise it’s anything that dones’t easily shortcut to another digital experience. Something to piggyback on what I’m already giving my attention.

Should we try and reclaim this? Or is this a pre-iphone skill? Like spelling, or memory. Of course we should. By understanding what activities we value enough to give our full attention to, allows us to appreciate the time we spend doing them more, and if possible, maximise time doing this activities. You’ll be the happier for it. By just writing down the few things that I’ve done, where it has my full attention, the cost of spending time is worth every penny. For me, things I instantly realised I want to do more/try are all nature related. Scuba diving,

Every now and then the light catches the screen and I almost jump to answer the notification.

My phone was replaced last week, so the few things that function without being connected are notes, and the calendar app… I have nothing to distract myself for the 6 hours stop over. By only looking out over the searing tarmac, littered with heavy steel, bumble bee striped industrial equipment, I’d be hard pressed to actually say where I was—but maybe it’s just that uncomfortable blend of disorientation, and clammy pallor sitting heavy on my thoughts. I check Facebook multiple times a day, instagram and twitter much less frequently now. Why? To see what people are up to, and to a lesser extent, to keep on top of current affairs. Also I guess it’s our social barometer, we want to see who is having a better time than us, we want to be inspired about what we want to crave doing next. If we are being honest, I’d say it boils down to who is cataloguing experiences that we wish we had catalogued first?

(when this problem applies to us, and when it’s a problem)

The lack of wifi isn’t stopping me being on my phone. The many prohibiting signs are enough to deter me, and you’d have to be stupid in a way I don’t even think is possible anymore to pull out your phone at ones of these checkpoints now and start instagramming the shit out of everything. But it’s strange, and I can’t immediately think of another situation where something has my undivided attention.

I’m certain that none of this needs to be reiterated to you. Form waking up to going to sleep, I’m checking something, or have multiple things running in parallel, all for the illusion of being connected socially. I moved to Sydney at the beginning of the year, so the majority of messages I’m waking up to are sent from a different timezone. I have that window in the morning to reply, then I begin my morning routine. In the shower I guess you could say is undivided attention, but I’ve always wanted music in the shower. Not really a radio, but more my spottily account linked to wireless wifi speakers, I think would be amazing. Your morning routine is arguably more habitual autonomy, that things you are consciously giving your attention. But we crave it to permeate into every facet of our lives.  Whilst I was studying Industrial Design, smart mirrors were the major project of choice, and it’s surprising they haven’t broken into the market yet. Contextual feeds, news stories, weather reports so you know what’s best to wear, all just streaming in whilst you’re brushing your teeth is a very

(how we can live on the good side, and minimise the bad)

I’ve always been a people watcher, one of my favourite games it to try and guess what people do for a living. Yes, the game could be called, “Judging a book by it’s cover”, but after guessing a few professions, you really start to analyse the signals people are trying to send others around them. Some people are meticulously well put together, some wear expensive watches. Some luxury brands, that don’t look like luxury brands. Others boutique sunglasses, and even those with a dishevelled appearance are sending signals.

The signals we give off, voluntarily and subconsciously.

It’s a skill I’m very aware I’m loosing. Like spelling, there is so much there to enable it, the path of least resistance is to succumb to it. I’m joining a scuba diving school, an a few other stereotypically Australian things for this reason.

There’s a joy, admittedly an uncomfortable one, in just having attention to something that is there, in front of us, that has a tangible output.


My goal in writing is to have better clarity in how I communicate. Better describe what I’m thinking, better cut down what isn’t necessary. Clarity is king.

Order & Chaos

scenario prompting some form of adapted relationship/behaviour
how this is common to peers, and the larger community.
what is designs role in this.

This is brought into sharp realisation on approach into London. Where most of my two week holiday is going to be a crazy whirlwind of trying to see as many faces as I can before  head back to Sydney.

The heat distorted ripples of planes in the distance.

Despite the voice over just telling us it’s highs of 31 today, habit has trumped logic, and I’ve ordered a large latte with one sugar, so it’ll be a while before this thing’s enjoyable to drink.
