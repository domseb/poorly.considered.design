title: The Rhythm of Work

description: This post started 2 years ago during a fortnight break in London after a particularly stressful time at work, and has been simmering in the background since. Design and my role within it has changed, and the parts I really enjoy happen less and less. The nagging question remains - what is keeping me doing this?

I was about 7 or 8 when I first found out what a designer was, and it blew my mind. . I watched Big, and found I entered design with a nice clear focus on the area I wanted to be in. The bigger the design system you operate within though, and the more points of friction there are that keep you in that area. These points of friction are normally in the process.

I find it hard to get moments of clarity in my work day. The day is littered with distractions. I don't mean Facebook, or checking Twitter - but meetings, shoulder taps and emails. These things kill productivity. Meetings are like mail. Before you have them, they are all you want. Meetings make people feel important, that they are making decisions - but they awful time wasters.  Open offices are a convenient trend in startups - cheaper office space and you can cram in more workers under the illusion of productivity - but it's crap.

I was strolling through a forgotten side street in East London, the afternoon sun warming the cobbled brickwork and graffiti, when I stumbled upon the nicest little bookstore. This place had a tangible mood in the air - he loved his work, and his work was fulfilling to him. I thought to myself, how have I found myself in such an abusive relationship with my own work?

I think everyone has their story of why they started in their industry. My favourites are. Creating something, anything really, feels great. It's deeply satisfying to have worked on something that then.

I'd been working 14 hour days to get design ready for a big event for one of our flagship products, along with a few other product feature releases. It's not my first rodeo, but this was the longest sustained period of this kind of work I've done. It wasn't horrible, but it was exhausting to the point of questioning why the hell am I doing this?

The best breaks are made of moments on serendipity like this, natural points of reflection in where I’m at in life.

I listen to Thunderspace to help me focus. But if I could, I'd listen to Green Acre park on repeat.


3. train of thought getting to all the side projects
4. time to write, reading list impossibly long from pocket to fit into two weeks I was away
5. why am I not doing these things at the moment?
6. first read this idea of not working on going on better holidays, but work on making your life less in need of a holiday
7. tending the spark
8. time for dust to settle
9. vacuum of no work — reading
10. finding the joy of creating again
11. noticing the oscillating focus of trying to specialise in and out of an area

got a list of side projects, some really stinkers, but one has some promise. and I’m happy to say I’m going to be pursuing it. That is all

this week I’ve had breakfast at home, with coffee and fresh juice, reading something from my kindle, and left at a reasonable time - and the walls didn’t fall down.

today as I write this I’ve tried yoga, and for the first time I’ve actually completed a draft of this ready to send to friends for review.

the idea of cities being able to influence your outcomes
about our obsession with work. and how it strangled your time with what you really care about

1. Freelancing, never worked in an established design company. This tension of having to establish processes, it’s exhausting. Why do we continue with it?
2. Because when it works, it’s exhilarating. When everything aligns, it feels like magic.
3. The uphill challenge.
4. How can I get to increasing the frequency of this. Making the climb more enjoyable.

**worthy mention**
1. Seth Godin - not about finding a better holiday, but making a life you don’t need to take a holiday from

1. Recently we’ve sacrificed experimentation at the beginning of projects, and ease in handover for just getting through the work. The next project will be better, we’ll improve that next time.
2. Talk on this is a crowded room, so I won’t have anything new to add to it. But I will say there is a lot to be done. Get shit done
3. Design sprints. And a relentless push on productivity is damaging to long term happiness in design.
4. it’s hard to attach lasting meaning to transient moments. Improve the surroundings or get out and walk.

**worthy mention**

Dom goodrum - permission to daydream

1. so much chatter. I don’t care about Slack vs hip chat. or sketch vs photoshop. and I especially don’t care about commentary on flat design. I care about how considered design solutions are and how you’re finding meaning in your work. how you unceremoniously are pushing product changes, with no one knowing the internal points of friction that you overcame to get there.
2. working forward. value capture at work. How to enjoy the journey.
3. what is the key components to be carried forward by the characters?
		4. relationship with work
		5. finding meaning in your work
		6. hobby vs work
		7. considered design and finding meaning
8. “falling in love with the new”
9. do what you love vs love what you do

- there’s so much talk about tools at the moment, and little on the craft we are actually trying to build meaningfully
- dawning realisation that I’ve been doing it wrong and how easy it is to fall into. and by doing it right, I’ll be more satisfied as a designer and be better at my craft as well
- I used to think side projects were for people unhappy at work, but they are actually for keeping sane creatively.
- don’t yield to the demanding pressure of work, it’ll burn you out, and if you want to be working like that in 20/30 years then good luck to you, but for the rest of us
- a promise to work on the craft, and to stop mindlessly discussing the tools. take the time.

The Rhythm of Work

- - -

1. Starting out, drunk in love with the possibility of it all.
2. Then residual tensions, the parts that need to be done for the design to happen, pull you away from the parts of the work that you love
3. points of friction taking you away from getting their fast
4. get in the way of the fun part of design. The challenge of it
5. slowly. layers harden over the core reason you started
6. residual tensions pull you away from the passion. meetings. feedback cycles. file management. handovers. reporting up
7. energised by others making meaningful steps. like a bad relationship, after a few years you have to question, why am I still doing this?
8. You’ve lost touch with experimentation. No dates anymore. It’s predictable and you’re not your best anymore. You’re not trying. Buy in all time low.
9. Always felt they are out movie stars of design. Gleaming smiles in interviews, effortlessly pushing their products and companies ahead with meaningful design decisions.

**Worthy Mentions**
1. Dylan Baskind. Sickeningly good at multiple things. Too many things.
2. David Muhr. Can’t remember why.

Ben chestnut - love what you do

Finding meaning in your work vs creating meaning.


A lot of us are in bad, abusive relationships with our work. We give them everything, and when they don't return the favour, we promise ourselves they'll change, and when they never do, we promise ourselves some more.
