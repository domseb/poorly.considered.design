description: I had this domain for over a year before my site went live, delayed by countless redesigns. What I wanted it to be and what I wanted it to say, changed almost weekly. It felt I started designing with such a clear intention, how had it all become so diffused?

Designing your own site is a painful process. Every aspect added and everything removed is centered around one gnawing question – what does this to say about me as a designer? Is this font expressive enough for the hero? Are these colours complimenting each other? How does the layout guide the eye? My design would start to take shape, and before it could solidify, I'd see some beautifully designed site - and I'd want to click and drag everything into the bin and start over again. The whole process looks something like this:

Redesigning personal site process:
Start redesign > see amazing site > self loathing

So I started out with a fairly clear idea of what I wanted to create, my palette was clean. But the problem I've found as a designer is, we overexpose ourselves to design intentionally every day.

Your palette is clean, but bit by bit you're adding in references and touches from all this other work you expose yourself to.

Then every morning you check Designer News first thing, Product Hunt, and head over to Instagram. Maybe a little Tumblr if that's your thing. You see an absurd amount of work from people, normally at the top of the game, and bit by bit it can warp your judgement of what you initially set out to create in your own site. Your judgement.

elements you love in other sites, try and incorporate them into your work. Adding piece by piece. And everntually you've mixed brown.


And understanding what you like, and being able to articulate why you like it, is the basis of your taste. Subjectivity aside, the main problem with taste with design is the same problem with having good taste in anything.

Talk on the "homogenisation" of design is a crowded topic, and I don’t have anything meaningful or new to add to it. But I will say there is a lot to be said for. Confusing taste with familiarity.


I read something great recently from the NYT, [The End of Reflection](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/fashion/internet-technology-phones-introspection.html?ref=technology).

It's the disease of a self paced design project. So it's easy to just go round and round in circles.

It's like trying to mix paint in art class. You add a little bit here, a little bit there, and you just end up mixing brown.

This site also marked another first for me - buying my first font from a foundry. There are a

The only reason I tried to make this site myself was because of one of the designers I work. He's with is amazing, and I'm in a very fortunate position where he can build everything we design.
