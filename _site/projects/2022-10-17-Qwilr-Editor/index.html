    <h1>Crafting a best in class editor</h1>
    <p>I worked on the Qwilr editor for the full 5 years I was at the company, taking it from a simple but nascent offering, to a leading market differentiator. Trying to convey that effort in a succinct way is a challenge in itself, but the breadth and depth I got to explore has been a career highlight. The transformation in  that time is something I’m incredibly proud of, and below are some cherry picked highlights of that journey.</p>

        <p>In early 2017, Qwilr’s editor was in its infancy. It promised a quick way for anyone to create highly visual &amp; interactive proposals, but controls were also limited and highly guard-railed, clashing with the long standing mental models created by Word et al. Core editing behaviours were also inconsistent, buggy, and often unclear to new customers, and our lack of intention designing them was reflected in the code that built them. Struggling to update capabilities or introduce new ones, we decided to redesign and rebuild the editor’s foundations. To rethink how every editing experience should work holistically, and build on for years to come.</p>

      <h3>Defining holistic behaviours</h3>
      <p>
        Even the simplest of editor behaviours come with dozens of questions about how it should work. If I paste a heading at the end of body text, what should happen? What if I paste it in the middle of body text? What if it’s multiple headings in my clipboard? How does this change if I’m pasting into a table? I had to break down every single behaviour in the editor, identify redundancy and inconsistencies, and resolve them to feel intuitive and predictable to users.

      <h3>Unifying toolbars</h3>
      <p>
        Staunchly against “Adam Admin” personas, I spent time with customers to create our foundational JTBD across the company. Helping understand customer drivers, and summarised them into cards, to be actionable in brainstorming meetings and projects. After some wrestling, I worked with the Head of Engineering and Head of Product to create teams around these JTBD.

      <h3>Layers of focus</h3>
      <p>
        While the panel gave them a way to manage the tokens, and navigate them quickly, we wanted to enable a faster way to add them in the flow of writing content. Leveraging the old curly braces as the keyboard shortcut, I designed a new panel lookup for customers. Letting them see what tokens were available to them in context, and adding them without needing to leave their keyboard.

        <p>As Qwilr was adopted by more agencies and SMBs, frustration grew with the editor’s limited styling capabilities. Table stakes features were missing, the outcomes possible were too constrained,  and customers didn’t feel like it was a good reflection of their brand. This frustration was translating to 30% customer churn, and being so integral to Qwilr’s value as a product, we committed to a complete feature re-write. To make it easy for customers to create visually rich pages, that are a great representation of their brand. </p>

      <h3>Style shortcuts</h3>
      <p>
        Highly interactive experiences need lots of prototyping, and collaboration, to really know if something feels right to use. An ambassador for mountaineering as a model of collaboration, I ran offsites, kickoffs, retreats and projects for PMs, Design &amp; Engineers to start together. Balance blindspots and biases early, and leverage the collective knowledge to create the best solution for the customer.

      <h3>Contextual controls</h3>
      <p>
        As the number of teams grew, the visibility of their work became more opaque and siloed. After reading Creativity Inc and Creative Selection, I wanted to create a demo culture that changed that, showcasing progress on the actual customer experience. I facilitated weekly showcase that rotated team reps, shared context of what they were working on, and a way to get feedback from fresh eyes that weren’t in the trenches of the project. It was by far, my favourite meeting of the week.

      <h3>Visual permissions</h3>
      <p>
        Designing and building a tool you never use, makes you blind to its faults. I wanted teams to have greater empathy with the tools they were creating, and find faults and opportunities to improve them well before they were shipped. I created the dogfooding &amp; beta practices for product teams, to bring in perspectives that balanced the teams blindpots and biases, helped us and deliver a more refined experience to customers.

            <p>As key projects were rewriting substantial part of the editor (and at that time, the epicentre of the app), I used it as an opportunity to redefine and restock our then fledgling design system — Kaleidoscope. Through close partnership with Engineers, in just a few months we had the foundations of our core components, patterns and thinking live and ready to leverage across the product teams.</p>

        <p>Frustrated with teams heads down, constantly in the weeds of quarterly planning, I wanted to create space to resolve complex experience debt, and take a meaningful leap forward for customers and the business. To me the best explorations are like mountaineering — where Designers, Engineers and PMs have the freedom to explore independently, but come together early and often. My role was to paint a picture of the peak we were trying to reach, to create the space and direction to solve it well, and contribute concepts.</p>

      <h3>Enabling multi Column</h3>
      <p>
        Partnering with Dylan, we first prototyped concepts without constraint, following intuition we’d developed by marinating in the space. The initial goal was to innovate on Qwilr’s core capabilities, exploring bigger bets and rethinks that could accelerate the timeline to deliver on the company strategy.  From it sprouted a primitive but interactive collection of product concepts and themes for teams to validate and build off.

      <h3>Interactive packages</h3>
      <p>
        Early decisions around the editor’s mental and interaction models were making it less and less malleable to shape, and harder to push it into new directions. To explore long simmering rethinks, resolve core experience debt, and unlock new opportunities, I created a vision exploration project called Editor 2025. Exploring what we could do with the editor in a timeline outside of quarterly planning, socialised it with teams, and lead ideation with design team.

      <h3>Empowering buyer experiences</h3>
      <p>
        As we explored Editor 2025, we were gravitating to a well trodden problem — styling qwilr pages. The early transformation concepts would help deepen our differentiator, and unlock capabilities for our growing enterprise accounts. I worked with Hamish to kickoff design sprints, helping accelerate and refine concepts, and engage peers in editor to adjust our roadmap to prioritise this transformation work.
