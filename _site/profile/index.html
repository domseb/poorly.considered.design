    That's the American one, you berk! I didn't even know Smarties made a cereal. They don't, it's just Smarties in a bowl with milk. It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... No, no there you go, no there you go. I just heard it come on.

    Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them!... Actually, that doesn't work, as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages. Hello? Is this the emergency services? See the driver hooks a function by patching the system call table, so its not safe to unload it unless another thread's about to jump in there and do its stuff, and you don't want to end up in the middle of invalid memory!
