      <h1>My name's Dominic.</h1>
      <p>
        Dominic Sebastian, a designer by profession, finds himself obsessively
        thinking about how to practice more considered design. Even as he makes
        progress, the work never stops, and he faces new challenges in finding
        creative fulfillment.

    Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot? Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them!... Actually, that doesn't work, as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages. Huh, what you think I'm afraid of you? I'm not afraid of you. OK. Moss, what did you have for breakfast this morning? Smarties cereal. How can you two... Don't Google the question, Moss! Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them!... Actually, that doesn't work, as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages.

    It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... No, no there you go, no there you go. I just heard it come on. Huh, what you think I'm afraid of you? I'm not afraid of you. Huh, what you think I'm afraid of you? I'm not afraid of you. I'm going to murder you... You bloody woman! Today I have a business empire the like of which the world has never seen the like of which. I hope it doesn't sound arrogant when I say that I am the greatest man in the world!
