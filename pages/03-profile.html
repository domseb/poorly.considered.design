      <h2>More about this human.</h2>
      <p>
        Dominic Sebastian, a designer by profession, finds himself obsessively
        thinking about how to practice more considered design. Even as he makes
        progress, the work never stops, and he faces new challenges in finding
        creative fulfillment.

    Outside of design, writing and film are my main passions, and are something
    I’m going to be working on more this year. If you have an interesting
    project and want to collaborate, email me or reach out on Twitter - I'd love
    to hear from you.

      <p>
        2020 has been a complete shit show, for all the obvious reasons and a
        few very personal ones. Next year I want to be better, and put all of
        this behind me with progress.
