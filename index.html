      <h3>Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve helped companies focus on their differentiator in the market, and define the strategies to help them leverage it. From design principles, product strategies, and feature north stars, I pride myself in using words to inform, guide and empower teams to do their most impactful work.

      <h3>Execution</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve lead a wide range of projects in my career. From first foundations, to full platform redesigns. My expertise is helping companies design and deliver intuitive, empowering and impactful projects to their customers.       </p>

      <h3>Systems</h3>
      <p>
        As an executive in early startups, I’ve learned how to design systems that enable scale. Design systems, R&D operations, team practices and weekly rituals — I love helping companies create systems that streamline work, strengthen creative cultures, and optimise for quality.      </p>

      <h3>Futures</h3>
      <p>
        I get energised helping companies explore what a big leap forward for their product could look, feel and function like. These help align and rally around where the product is going, help validate directions with customers, and visualise ambitious product strategies.       </p>
